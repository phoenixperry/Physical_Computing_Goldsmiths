##Lab Task 4

Due: Dec. 8th at 3PM 

**Instructions:**

4.1 Complete the Major Project proposal form and submit it on learn.gold.

4.2 Building off of 4.6 **CIRC11: Relay**
http://oomlout.com/a/products/ardx/circ-11, Use a potentiometer to change the relay's switching interval. Report the switching duration to the Serial Monitor, in milliseconds.
Make a video of this.

4.3 Watch this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYH9dGl4gUE 
Guess what? You're half my capacitor baby because we touch there's a spark. Ever walk across the carpet and shock someone? Now know you know why. You can store a charge. 

Let's use that fact to make a keyboard.  

Using the Capacitive Touch sensors in the lab, make a synth keyboard controlled by capacitive touch. Pete will have this outside class hours. You can ask him for to work with. He will also have copper tape. Remember the potentiometer we drew? How about aluminum foil? Anything conductive can work as your pads. All 12 pad will need to be hooked up for any of them to work.  

To do this you'll need to download a library and place it into your libraries folder, then restart Arduino. 

If you don't have a libraries folder yet, make one. It should be at the root of the folder where all your sketches are. So something like Documents > Arduino > libraries 

Here's the library: 
https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_MPR121_Library 

There's an example in the examples file in the folder. Try it out. 

The wiring for the external IC chip is in the circuits folder for this lab.  

Make a of someone playing your new instrument. Added bonus? Give it some light! Get creative! Have fun. 


**FINAL PROJECT: SUBMIT YOUR PROPOSAL FORM BY NEXT TUESDAY AT 3!**
