##Final Project 
Make sure you fill out the final project proposal form here

The final project makes up a substantial proportion of your mark for the course. This is the approval form for your final project. You will need sign-off from the course tutor, or you will not receive credit for this work. 

You will be assessed on the criteria below. Everything below should be in bold, but that would defeat the purpose of bold text. Your project does not have to be an original idea, but it must to do the following:

* Use at least two INPUTS in any combination: two digital, two analogue, or one of each (no inputs = FAIL)
* Use at least one OUTPUT such as: an actuator of any type OR an on-screen display (no outputs = FAIL)
* Have a suitable housing AND/OR an on-screen display (up to 30% of mark)
* Include a detailed log, with entries for each week that you are working on the project (Weeks 6-9), including text, code, photos and schematics, where relevant. Each person’s contribution must be clear each week, or nobody will receive credit. (up to 30% of mark)
* Include a final presentation, consisting of either: PowerPoint of not more than 5 slides and a short presentation OR a short video of less than 3 minutes describing the project and demonstrating how it works. (20% of mark)
The Major Project must represent a conceptual exploration of the intellectual material presented in this course. There will be essays and reading material throughout the term. The thinking there I care about the why, the what and the how in that order. You will be expected to present the project in an organized pdf presentation and you should think carefully as to why you choose a specific project.

Prepare the following to share in class during the last lab of the term:

* Set up the project. Tell us the story of why you are doing what you are doing. What are you investigating? What inspired you? What is the social context your project operates within?
* What challenges did you over come?
* At least 2 or 3 images on the same slide of your project in progress.
* A 200-300 word write up detailing your objectives
* If appropriate, a video of your project with narrative voice over
* A Fritzing or other circuit diagram for your hardware
* Any code used in the project must be zipped and included with the final pdf. 
* the working final project presentation (or video if your installation occurred elsewhere and your just showing what's possible.)
* What are the future possibilities for this project?

* Be exhibited. You must physically show the project in class on your presentation day. Internet connectivity may not be possible in class, so if the operation of the project requires access to the Internet (e.g., a tweeting toaster), you should test that it works in advance. Points will be deducted if the project does not work. If the project is site-specific and cannot be brought to class, you must demonstrate it working through a video in class on the day of presentations. (20% of mark)
* The final project is estimated to require a minimum of 40 hours to complete, but probably more. These are the minimum project requirements. Minimal projects will receive minimal marks. Projects that use more actuators or sensors than the minimum requirement will receive better marks. Exceptional projects may receive distinction. You could use the projects we have referenced on learn.gold as inspiration for a final project to complete.

Your participation is part of the project mark. If your project partner is failing to deliver and this is causing a problem, you should bring this to my attention as soon as possible to resolve the issue.

The project proposal is completed as a form (see link below) to be completed one of the project partners. You can specify the names of both team members on the form.

NOMINATE ONE PROJECT PARTNER TO BE THE LEAD OF THE PROJECT TO SUBMIT THE PROPOSAL ON BEHALF OF YOUR GROUP. There is a form here to fill out:
