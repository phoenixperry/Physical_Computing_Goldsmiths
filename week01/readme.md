###Lab Task 1
Due 11/25/2015. 

Instructions:

1. First, make sure that you can make an LED blink on and off. This is the first exercise in the Arduino booklet.

2. Then design a system to make 10 LEDs blink, one after the other. Make sure to use a 560 Ohm resistor for each LED, to prevent your LEDs from using too much current. If you are unsure about how to wire up your LEDs, follow the same approach used in exercise CIRC-02 in your Exerimenter's guide.

3. Experiment with different patterns.

4. Have a look at the Arduino References.  Use at least one function from the reference in your own code.  An example would be to look at the random() function and understand how to add it to your code.  Any code you write, please add comments to describe what you expect it to do.

Record your video at this point.

Start noticing any sensors in the real world.  If you notice them - add them to the "in the WILD"  forum to increase your participation mark.

##To hand in your assignment

Submit a zip file 

You must use the following format to record your work. 
In one zip archive please create the following: 
###A document with the following sections: 
1. Requirements: What Design problem are you going to solve with this task?
2. Analysis: What hardware components will you need? What software will you use to support the requirements? 
3. Interactivity Design/Scenario: What kind of interaction will the system support. What are the inputs and outputs? 
4. Notes and Testing: What problems did you encounter and overcome? This should be the longest section of your work. I would expect a minimum of 200 words here. 
5. Diagrams: Images of a breadboard diagram and schematic diagram. The breadboard diagram and the schematic diagram image are exported from Fritzing. This means you should draw the circuit you built using Fritzing and output both a Diagram and a Schematic. 
6. Video: A short video documenting your project <1 minute. This can be a link to youtube or vimeo. 
7. A word on code. All code must be attached and well commented in the zip archive with the document containing the above 6 sections. Any code files will count as the 7th section. Name the files clearly and if you need to tell me anything about the code, add it into your in a section7.
