Assignments:

(note, you might want to jump to step four and paint your sensor now so you can take it home for further experimentation) 

Task 1: Measure the resistance of a resistor using a multimeter. Make a short video of this and upload it.

Task 2: Hook up a button to turn an LED on when it pressed from your Arduino.  There's a schematic 

Task 3: Hook up a potentiometer you drew using a pencil and clips. Print the results out in the Serial port. Now try a bit of paint. How does it differ? Also try it with some copper tape. See what is the reaction is.

Task 4: Play one tone using the tone() function  with Arduino. You'll need code that's on github in week02 called melody.ino 

Task 5: Create this: 

github.com/phoenixperry/visualSynth 

Now using this as inspiration, create your own analog visual synth. It should contain a few new features. Maybe a series of buttons for different notes, or perhaps a different visualization? Lights? A painted keyboard?

Task 6: Make you first LED throwy social interaction! With a few classmates go light something up on campus. NOTE! Clean up after and bring maerials back. Next week we'll make advanced throwies so we'll need the parts.
