###Lab Task 2 
Due 01/12/2015. 

Assignments:

Task 1. Measure the resistance of a resistor using a multimeter. 

Task 2. Hook up a button to turn an LED on when it pressed from your Arduino.  Here's a schematic

Task 3. Hook up a potentiometer you drew using a pencil and clips. Print the results out in the Serial port. Now try a bit of paint. How does it differ? Also try it with some copper tape to act as a wire and connect two pieces of a drawing. See what is different reaction is. 

DANGER. DO NOT CONNECT THE POWER AND THE GROUND TO ONLY COPPER TAPE. YOU WILL BLOW YOUR ARDUINO. 

Here's how a normal knob is hooked up. Remember clips can act as the metal wiper in the case, or the middle pin on the knob going into your board.

Task 4. Play one tone using the tone() function  with Arduino. You'll need code that's on github in week02/code here https://github.com/phoenixperry/Physical_Computing_Goldsmiths/blob/master/week02/code/melody/melody.ino

Task 5. Create this:

Task 6. For the report, using what we just did as inspiration, create your own analog visual synth. It should contain a few new features. Maybe a series of buttons for different notes, or perhaps a different visualization? Lights? A painted keyboard?

Could you even try a light dependent resistor, or an LDR to control the tone? 
Here's how a LDR is wired up if you'd like to try and use it:

**Record the video and write the report for Task 6.**

####To hand in your assignment. 

Submit a zip file 

You must use the following format to record your work. 
In one zip archive please create the following: 
#####A document with the following sections: 
1. Requirements: What Design problem are you going to solve with this task?
2. Analysis: What hardware components will you need? What software will you use to support the requirements? 
3. Interactivity Design/Scenario: What kind of interaction will the system support. What are the inputs and outputs? 
4. Notes and Testing: What problems did you encounter and overcome? This should be the longest section of your work. I would expect a minimum of 200 words here. 
5. Diagrams: Images of a breadboard diagram and schematic diagram. The breadboard diagram and the schematic diagram image are exported from Fritzing. This means you should draw the circuit you built using Fritzing and output both a Diagram and a Schematic. 
6. Video: A short video documenting your project <1 minute. This can be a link to youtube or vimeo. 
7. A word on code. All code must be attached and well commented in the zip archive with the document containing the above 6 sections. Any code files will count as the 7th section. Name the files clearly and if you need to tell me anything about the code, add it into your in a section7.
