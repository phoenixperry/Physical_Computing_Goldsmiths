Assignments:

(note, you might want to jump to step four and paint your sensor now so you can take it home for further experimentation) 

Task 1: Measure the resistance of a resistor using a multimeter. Make a short video of this and upload it.

Task 2: Hook up a button to turn an LED on when it pressed from your Arduino.  Here's a schematic

Task 3: Hook up a potentiometer you drew using a pencil and clips. Print the results out in the Serial port. Now try a bit of paint. How does it differ? Also try it with some copper tape to act as a wire and connect two pieces of a drawing. See what is different reaction is. 

DANGER. DO NOT CONNECT THE POWER AND THE GROUND TO ONLY COPPER TAPE. YOU WILL BLOW YOUR ARDUINO. 

Here's how a normal knob is hooked up. Remember clips can act as the metal wiper in the case, or the middle pin on the knob going into your board.

Task 4: Play one tone using the tone() function  with Arduino. You'll need code that's on github in week02/code here https://github.com/phoenixperry/Physical_Computing_Goldsmiths/blob/master/week02/code/melody/melody.ino


Task 5: Create this:

Now using this as inspiration, create your own analog visual synth. It should contain a few new features. Maybe a series of buttons for different notes, or perhaps a different visualization? Lights? A painted keyboard?

Could you even try a light dependent resistor, or an LDR to control the tone? 
Here's how a LDR is wired up if you'd like to try and use it:
