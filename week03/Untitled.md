About two and half years ago, after getting told on twitter there were no women in indie games, I raddled off a list of names of good friends in an google sheet to prove a point. There are no women? Here are some great games! Go play them. They rock. 

This little list then started to explode. People wanted on it so I opened it up and for months it was just this great open, growing list. 

The first lot of names are names of people I know and really supported. I added a whole 67 names, all of which were friends. I left the list open and people started adding their names and names of friends. 

The first problems with the list started when a women I didn't know copied my list and then started distributing it out of context of just a list of cool women to follow and games to play. She contextualized it as a way to diversity conference panels, which wasn't my intent originally. This was the first round of blow back that hit me because people didn't like it and of course they came and shouted at me over it. In my belief the list was valid, so I kept it up and open. Don't want on it? Remove yourself. Want on it? Add yourself. I always just wanted it to be a list of fun games and good devs, fan and creator generated alike. 

But as the story goes, gamergate happened. The list was wiped clean and I had to restore it. Unfortunately, one woman who had asked to be removed I had removed, Anna Anthropy was in the version I restored from. That's 100% my fault. I should have done this on github or something but I never really took it that seriously. It was just a nice, open resource. After I restored it, it was wiped again. My solution was to just lock it down and have a form for input. Problem? Getting removed now involved asking me. It has been a very long time (over a year) since anyone asked and over 200+ women added themselves so I was not so worried about it. It was also just a google doc, not a site, not something with much of a public face at all.  

However, I did start to have a growing concern about how it could been seen or used. I then just took it down out of fear it was going to be used as a targeting list. I left it down for months. The other day I thought, well I think this has died down. I'll repost it. 

On a slack channel called games and play people *freaked out* when it was reposted while I was sleeping. They used the one accidentally repasted name, Anna Anthropy's, to trump it up that I was transphobic and putting women in danger. Granted, all of the info was public and on the indiecade site in a far more visible way. Anna had tweeted at me and when I woke up, I immediately removed her again. Anyone who asked for a change got it in a few hours. 

That said the damage was done. People said really mean, hurtful and hateful things. I was kicked off games and play before I was even allowed to respond and hate overflowed in my inbox. 

I re-opened the list to universal edits. Three people took themselves off. 

A hate mob was launched against me by 3 people. They said I was transphobic and it now lives online. They said my org, Code Liberation, endangers trans women and they basically ruined my day. 

My advice? People are going to attack you if you do something - anything - at all. 

297 women are still there. 

297 women, many of who are on that slack channel didn't remove themselves. 

Scores of friends came out in private support. 

These are dangerous times and the gamergate mob is just as real as the indie mob. 

Honestly, my feeling now is fuck it. Just keep fighting the fight. It's far easier to tear something down than build it up. 

I'd rather build. :D
