###Lab Task 3 
Due 1/12/2015. 

Before doing these tasks hook up CIRC03 and CIRC04 from your kits. 

3.1 Attach the Light Dependent Resister (LDR) to an analog input pin. Wire it up with a voltage divider circuit that results in a good range of analog readings. (ie: not a range of 0 to 10). Use the Serial console to assess the resulting readings. AKA experiment with the map() function from the ardino sdk.

3.2 Add an LED to a PWM pin on the Arduino and change the PWM duty cycle of that LED using the LDR (The closer your hand gets to the LDR, the brighter the LED and vice versa)

3.3 Make this night light using the P2N2 transistor in your kit. Experiment with 3v and 5v and see how the sensor changes.

**Make a short video demonstrating this.** 

3.4 Solder 3 Leds and 560 resistors to perf board and attach them to 3 different pins on the Arduino. Turn them on and off randomly. 

**Make a short video demonstrating this.** 

3.5 Attach a SERVO motor to your breadboard. Rotate the servo in one direction and then the other. Use the servo library included in Arduino 

3.6 Use a sensor of some kind (LDR or POTENTIOMETER) to control the position of the SERVO. In your write-up in Section 4 below, in addition to describing your testing and notes, describe how you might use this in a project.

3.7 Add a PWM-controlled LED pin to this setup and link the LEDs brightness to the rotation of the Servo motor. **Make a video of this.**

**FINAL PROJECT:** Continue thinking about a final project and identifying a partner to work with.

**Documentation:**
You must use the following format, in 7 sections, to record your work. Sections 1-6 must be in a .pdf document with highlightable text (aka make sure I can click your youtube links). Zip this .pdf up with your code files and submit it on learn.gold 

**Requirements**
(What Design problem are you going to solve with this task?)

**Analysis**
(What hardware components will you need? What software will you use to support the requirements?)

**Interactivity Design/Scenario**
(What kind of interaction will the system support. What are the inputs and outputs?)

**Notes and Testing**
(What problems did you encounter and overcome? This should be the longest section of your work. I would expect a minimum of 200 words here.)

**Diagrams**
Images of a breadboard diagram and schematic diagram. The breadboard diagram and the schematic diagram image are exported from Fritzing. This means you should draw the circuit you built using Fritzing and output both a Diagram and a Schematic.  

**Videos:**
A short video documenting your project <1 minute, linked from YouTube using the "old embed code" option.

**Code:**
All the Arduino project folders with the enclosed .ino files
