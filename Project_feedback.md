######Team: Blind Mind: Guilherme Villar Piccinini de Magalh√£es, Andrew Tao, Natasha Mason 
https://blindmindsite.wordpress.com/ 

Using a gadget with built in LDR sensors and a camera as well as using an arduino interaction with open frameworks. The project will try to represent what a blind person can see, traveling through different levels of blindness. In deep levels of blindness there will be an attempt to show an abstract representation of what their eyes sense and what they imagine.

**Feedback:**
* A nicer quality enclosure for the components would raise this mark  
* this piece would of been a more realistic experience using google cardboard or the rift 
* The user interface values could not be visible or that UI could be a toggle 
* Where this project shines is the empathy experience 
* User testing with people who have limited sight or are Blind would of been a nice addition 
* lacking design polish in the enclosure

###### Air Drum: Shao Cheok 
http://shaocheok.wordpress.com

This project is an attempt to create a new option for drummers to their choice of equipment, with focus on maintaining the original drumming experience but improving mobility and portability. The drummer will retain his normal drumming experience like collision and body motion, where the difference is that they no longer have to move the drum set itself, because the drum set exist in virtual environment. All they have to do is connect the microcontroller and the components onto their body/drumsticks, and they can just start drumming with a pair of drumsticks, a laptop and a speaker, anywhere they like.**Feedback:**
* Let's make sure to really test if multiplexing accelerometer data 
* You can hot glue down the thread to improve the circuit 
* Add your diagrams to your blog 
* Good use of flexible design for the wearable w/the bands

######Team: Virtual Reality Suit 
Deividas Grigorjevas, Anthony Cannon 

In our project you will be placed in a Virtual Reality where you will be able to walk around using our jumpsuit. The jumpsuit will be able to detect body and limb movements using force sensors, bend sensors and a Gyroscope/Accelerometer.
